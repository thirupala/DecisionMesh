# DecisionMesh

**DecisionMesh** is an intent-driven decision control plane for AI systems.  
It provides a governed, observable, and extensible way to accept *intent*, execute internal AI tasks, and manage outcomes — without exposing low-level model or provider details to clients.

## Key Concepts

### Intent-Driven
Clients submit **intent**, not execution instructions.  
DecisionMesh determines *how* to fulfill the intent using policies, routing logic, and providers.

### Control Plane Architecture
DecisionMesh separates:
- **Intent ingestion (public APIs)**
- **AI task execution (internal)**
- **Observability, governance, and lifecycle management**

### Provider-Agnostic
No client ever selects:
- models
- vendors
- execution strategies

Those decisions remain internal and policy-driven.
